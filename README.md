# Phylogenetic-analysis-of-Arabidposis-centromeres
Scripts relating to the phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis centromeric sequences, for the purposes of Materials and Methods.

For visualistion of repeat sequences, see: 'Initial Visualisation of Repeat Lengths.ipynb'

For scripts exploring the best way to prepare the data, see:
'Analysis of Col-0 BLASTALL by Chromosome and Filtering.ipynb'
'General FASTA file generator.ipynb'
'BLASTCLUST Analysis.ipynb'


For scripts that generate FASTA files for use in mafft alignment, and later tree building, see:
'General FASTA file generator.ipynb'
'FASTA generator by chromosome.ipynb'
'Mega-tree FASTA file generator.ipynb'
'Col-0 Epigenetic and Structural data FASTA file generator.ipynb'

For scripts visualising Epigenetic and Structural Rearrangment data, see:
'Analysis of Epigenetic Data and Strucutral Arrangment Data for Col-0.ipynb'

For scripts visualising percentage identity of sequences, see:
't2t clustal.ipynb'

For scripts running mafft and iqtree, see:
'Run_tree__t2t180.sh'
'Run_tree__mega2.sh'

For scripts annotating and visualising trees, see:
tree_visualisation.py
